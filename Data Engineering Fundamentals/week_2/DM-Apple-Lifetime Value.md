# Apple - Lifetime Value
### 1. Background
Lifetime Value (LTV) is a crucial metric for businesses to quantify the total projected revenue a business can expect from a single customer account throughout the business relationship. Understanding LTV helps companies tailor their marketing strategies, optimize customer service, and prioritize resource allocation to maximize profitability.

### 2. Problem Description
The challenge is to design a data model that accurately captures and calculates the LTV for each customer based on their interactions, transactions, and engagement over their lifetime with the company. The model must handle varying customer behaviors, different types of transactions, and changes over time.

### 3. Answer: Data Model Creation

#### **Entities and Attributes**
- **Customer**: Stores basic customer information.
  - Attributes: CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, DateJoined, etc.
- **Transaction**: Records details about each transaction made by the customer.
  - Attributes: TransactionID, CustomerID, TransactionDate, Amount, ProductID, etc.
- **Product**: Information about products or services purchased.
  - Attributes: ProductID, Name, Price, CategoryID, etc.
- **CustomerInteraction**: Tracks other non-transactional interactions.
  - Attributes: InteractionID, CustomerID, InteractionType, InteractionDate, etc.

#### **Relationships**
- A **Customer** can have multiple **Transactions** (one-to-many).
- A **Customer** can have multiple **CustomerInteractions** (one-to-many).
- **Transactions** relate to **Products** (many-to-one).

#### **LTV Calculation Logic**
- LTV can be a calculated field in a BI tool or a periodically updated attribute in the customer table, based on aggregate transaction data and possibly influenced by interaction types (e.g., returns, complaints, positive feedback).
- Formula Example: \( LTV = (Average Order Value \times Purchase Frequency \times Customer Lifespan) \)
  - **Average Order Value**: Average dollar amount each customer spends per transaction.
  - **Purchase Frequency**: Total number of purchases divided by the lifespan of the account.
  - **Customer Lifespan**: Time since the first purchase.

This data model would allow Appleâ€™s data engineering team to not only store relevant customer data effectively but also calculate and utilize LTV for strategic business decisions. The model is scalable and can integrate various data sources to provide a comprehensive view of customer value.
