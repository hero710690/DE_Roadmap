### Problem Overview

You might be given a table that tracks transactions, confirmations, or some other form of validation, and your task is to identify cases where the confirmation is incorrect. The definition of "incorrect" could vary depending on the context but often involves checking mismatches between the expected and actual outcomes.

### Example Table Structure

Let’s assume you have a table named `Transactions` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status VARCHAR(50),  -- e.g., 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'PENDING'
    confirmed BOOLEAN,   -- e.g., TRUE if confirmed, FALSE if not
    confirmation_date DATE
);
```

This table records each transaction, including its status (whether it succeeded, failed, or is pending), whether it was confirmed, and the date of confirmation.

### Sample Data

Here’s what some sample data might look like:

| transaction_id | user_id | amount | status  | confirmed | confirmation_date |
|----------------|---------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1              | 101     | 100.00 | SUCCESS | TRUE      | 2024-08-01        |
| 2              | 102     | 50.00  | FAILED  | TRUE      | 2024-08-02        |
| 3              | 103     | 75.00  | SUCCESS | FALSE     | NULL              |
| 4              | 104     | 150.00 | PENDING | TRUE      | 2024-08-03        |
| 5              | 101     | 200.00 | SUCCESS | TRUE      | 2024-08-04        |
| 6              | 102     | 20.00  | FAILED  | FALSE     | NULL              |

### Problem Statement

1. **Identify transactions that have wrong confirmations.** For example, a confirmation might be wrong if:
    - A transaction with a `FAILED` status is confirmed.
    - A transaction with a `SUCCESS` status is not confirmed.
    - A transaction with a `PENDING` status is confirmed.
2. **List the transaction details for these wrong confirmations.**

### Solution Approach

To identify wrong confirmations, you need to check for discrepancies between the `status` of the transaction and the `confirmed` flag. Here are the common conditions:

- A `FAILED` transaction should not be confirmed.
- A `SUCCESS` transaction should be confirmed.
- A `PENDING` transaction should not be confirmed.

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT
    transaction_id,
    user_id,
    amount,
    status,
    confirmed,
    confirmation_date
FROM
    Transactions
WHERE
    (status = 'FAILED' AND confirmed = TRUE) OR
    (status = 'SUCCESS' AND confirmed = FALSE) OR
    (status = 'PENDING' AND confirmed = TRUE);
```

#### Explanation:

- **WHERE clause**:
  - **(status = 'FAILED' AND confirmed = TRUE)**: Identifies transactions that failed but were incorrectly confirmed.
  - **(status = 'SUCCESS' AND confirmed = FALSE)**: Identifies transactions that succeeded but were not confirmed, which could be an oversight.
  - **(status = 'PENDING' AND confirmed = TRUE)**: Identifies transactions that are still pending but were incorrectly confirmed.

**Result for Sample Data**:

Given the sample data, the query will return:

| transaction_id | user_id | amount | status  | confirmed | confirmation_date |
|----------------|---------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2              | 102     | 50.00  | FAILED  | TRUE      | 2024-08-02        |
| 3              | 103     | 75.00  | SUCCESS | FALSE     | NULL              |
| 4              | 104     | 150.00 | PENDING | TRUE      | 2024-08-03        |

These records indicate that:
- Transaction 2 was marked as `FAILED` but was incorrectly confirmed.
- Transaction 3 was marked as `SUCCESS` but was not confirmed.
- Transaction 4 was still `PENDING` but was incorrectly confirmed.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Handling NULL Values**: The `confirmation_date` might be `NULL` for unconfirmed transactions. Ensure that your query logic appropriately handles `NULL` values if necessary.
- **Data Validation**: Depending on the real-world context, there might be other conditions or business rules that define a "wrong" confirmation, which would require adjusting the query.
- **Time Frame**: If the problem requires checking confirmations within a specific period, add a `WHERE` clause to filter by `confirmation_date`.

### Real-world Application:

- **Financial Systems**: In financial systems, ensuring the accuracy of transaction confirmations is crucial for auditing and compliance. Incorrect confirmations can lead to financial discrepancies and legal issues.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: In e-commerce, incorrect order confirmations (e.g., confirming a failed payment) can lead to customer dissatisfaction and operational challenges.
- **Booking Systems**: In booking systems (e.g., for flights or hotels), incorrect confirmations can result in overbookings, customer complaints, and financial losses.

This approach gives you a clear and efficient way to identify and analyze wrong confirmations using SQL, providing valuable insights for data validation and error correction in various transactional systems.
