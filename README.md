# A comprehensive learning path for data enineering

To cover most of topics in data enineering fields, we'll have:
1. Data Engineering Fundamentals
2. Data Modeling
2. System Design for DE
3. SQL Problems / Advanced SQL Problems from FAANG
4. Python Data Engineer Code Practice

The above topics can be divided into 8 weeks practices.
- Week 1: Focus on the fundamentals of data engineering, including ETL processes and data pipelines. This week is all about building a solid foundation.

-  Week 2: Deep dive into data modeling. Learn about techniques like star schema, snowflake schema, and normalization vs. denormalization. Practice designing models for various scenarios.

- Weeks 2-4: Solve coding questions and basic to intermediate SQL queries, focusing on joins, subqueries, and aggregations.

- Weeks 5-7: Tackle advanced SQL problems, especially those commonly asked in FAANG interviews. Continue with Python coding to maintain proficiency.

- Week 8: Study distributed systems, scalability, and design data pipelines. Work on system design problems related to data engineering, using resources like the [System Design 101](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101). Additionally, review data modeling questions to reinforce your understanding before the interview.
