### Problem Overview

The problem might ask you to identify users who have listened to music on four consecutive days. The table typically contains user activity logs, where each row represents an instance of a user listening to a song, along with the date and possibly the time when the song was listened to.

### Example Table Structure

Let's assume you have a table named `UserListening` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE UserListening (
    user_id INT,
    listening_date DATE
);
```

### Sample Data

Here’s what some sample data might look like:

| user_id | listening_date |
|---------|----------------|
| 1       | 2024-08-01     |
| 1       | 2024-08-02     |
| 1       | 2024-08-03     |
| 1       | 2024-08-04     |
| 2       | 2024-08-01     |
| 2       | 2024-08-03     |
| 2       | 2024-08-04     |
| 3       | 2024-08-01     |
| 3       | 2024-08-02     |
| 3       | 2024-08-05     |

### Problem Statement

Find users who have listened to music on four consecutive days. Return the user IDs of these users.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can leverage window functions and some clever SQL logic.

### Step-by-Step SQL Solution:

1. **Identify Consecutive Days**: For each row, compute the difference between the `listening_date` and a sequence generated by the `ROW_NUMBER()` function. This difference will be the same for consecutive days.

2. **Group and Filter**: Group by the user ID and the difference calculated. For each group, count the number of days. If the count is 4 or more, then that group represents four consecutive days.

3. **Select Users**: Finally, select the user IDs that meet the criteria.

### SQL Query:

```sql
WITH ConsecutiveDays AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        listening_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY listening_date) AS rn
    FROM UserListening
),
GroupedConsecutiveDays AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        listening_date,
        DATE_SUB(listening_date, INTERVAL rn DAY) AS grp
    FROM ConsecutiveDays
),
UserConsecutiveCounts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS consecutive_days
    FROM GroupedConsecutiveDays
    GROUP BY user_id, grp
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM UserConsecutiveCounts
WHERE consecutive_days >= 4;
```

### Explanation:

1. **ConsecutiveDays CTE**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY listening_date)` assigns a unique sequential integer (`rn`) to each row within each user’s data, ordered by the `listening_date`.
   
2. **GroupedConsecutiveDays CTE**:
   - We compute a "group" for each consecutive sequence by subtracting `rn` from the `listening_date`. For consecutive dates, this difference will be the same, effectively grouping them together.

3. **UserConsecutiveCounts CTE**:
   - Group by user and the computed "group", counting the number of rows (days) in each group. If this count is 4 or more, it means the user listened for four consecutive days.

4. **Final Select**:
   - We filter to only those users who have groups with 4 or more consecutive days.

### Example Result:

Given the sample data:

| user_id | listening_date |
|---------|----------------|
| 1       | 2024-08-01     |
| 1       | 2024-08-02     |
| 1       | 2024-08-03     |
| 1       | 2024-08-04     |
| 2       | 2024-08-01     |
| 2       | 2024-08-03     |
| 2       | 2024-08-04     |
| 3       | 2024-08-01     |
| 3       | 2024-08-02     |
| 3       | 2024-08-05     |

The query will return:

| user_id |
|---------|
| 1       |

### Additional Considerations:

- **Handling Multiple Listening Sessions per Day**: If there are multiple entries for a user on the same day, you may want to `DISTINCT` or aggregate them first.
- **Performance**: Ensure that your table is indexed appropriately on `user_id` and `listening_date` for the best performance.

This is a typical type of question you'd encounter in a SQL interview, where understanding the underlying data and applying logical reasoning with SQL window functions is key to deriving the correct solution.
